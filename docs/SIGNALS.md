# Device signals

Every field the SDK may send to `/api/v1/enrich`, and the lowest
[attribution level](REACT_NATIVE_SDK.md#attribution-levels) at which each still
ships. Catalogue version 9.

A field absent from this table is never sent, at any level: the SDK drops
anything it cannot find in the catalogue rather than defaulting to
permissive.

**Level** — `minimal` also ships at `reduced` and `full`; `reduced` also
ships at `full`; `full` ships only at `full`. At `none` nothing is sent.

**When** — `static` is collected once per device and cached until the app,
OS or SDK version changes. `dynamic` is re-read on every send. `identity`
names the link or user being reported on rather than the device.

## User data

What the host app told us about the person, via `setUserData()` / `setUserId()`.
Not observed, not derived — values you supplied. They are sent as supplied and
hashed only when a conversion is forwarded to Meta or Google.

Classified `minimal`, so they survive a `.reduced` downgrade. The attribution
levels gate what the SDK *observes* about a device, and an email the person
typed into your app is not an observation. At `.none` nothing is sent, here as
everywhere.
